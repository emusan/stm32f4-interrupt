# STM32F4 Discovery Pin Interrupt Demo/Example

Just a quick little demo to teach myself how to work with the external 
interrupts (EXTIs) on the STM32F4 microcontroller.

Primarily focused on the Discovery board as it uses the Button and LED's on 
the board itself, though you could just as well use this on any other F4, but 
more work would be required.

# ENJOY!
